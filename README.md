# MagicalRecordExampleApp
[MagicalRecord](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord) is well known for adpoting Active Record pattern and proving  easy-to-use APIs for CURD operations.  

This is a working demo for using Magical Record in your app. I listed important features including:  

* setup Core Data stack
* perform general background save tasks
* background creation and update for an entity
* use FRC to backup table view


Some very important aspects about using Core Data in your application, such as synchronization between different contexts, are already implemented in Magical Record so that you don't have to worry about them.
